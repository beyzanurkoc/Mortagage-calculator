# Mortagage-calculator

 Develop a C program to calculate the interest accrued on a bank cus tomers mortgage. For each customer, the following facts are available:

a) the account number 
b) the mortgage amount
c) the mortgage term 
d) the interest rate

The program should input each fact, calculate the total interest payable (=mortgage amount x interest rate x mortgage term), and add it to the mortgage amount to get the total amount payable. It should calculate the required monthly payment by dividing the total amount payable by the number of months in the mortgage term. The program should display the required monthly pay ment rounded off to the nearest dollar. The program should process each customer's account at a time.
